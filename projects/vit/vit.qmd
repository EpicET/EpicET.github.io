## Overview
This project implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification tasks. The ViT architecture leverages self-attention mechanisms to process images as sequences of patches, enabling it to capture long-range dependencies and complex patterns in visual data.

## Features
- Takes in latent vectors
- Computes probabilities for each class (pneumonia or not pneumonia)
- Trains, tests and evaluates the model

## Technologies
Python, PyTorch, NumPy, scikit-learn
