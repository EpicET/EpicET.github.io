## Overview
This was my first project: a full-stack web application that simulates the functions of a bank website. The backend was built with Java Spring Boot and MongoDB as the database. The frontend uses React, with Axios as the API client between it and the local server.

## Features
- Profile:
    - Username
    - Password
    - Bank accounts (Checking/Savings)
- Banking features:
    - Deposit
    - Withdraw
    - Transfer
- Pie chart representing the balance of each account
- Transaction history table and graph for each account
- Database for storing user information
